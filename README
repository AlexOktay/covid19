##############   Project for CodeVsCovid19    ###############

This projects aims to predict exponential growth rate of the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in countries that have not yet been heavily impacted by the pandemix (i.e. less than 250 confirmed cases).
Through a Gradient Boosting machine learning model, we used social and economic data to identify countries most at risk (see file results => the lower the number the less at risk)
